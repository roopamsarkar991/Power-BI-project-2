A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.
Cleaned and transformed the data to make it ready for analysis. This involves tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
Used PowerBI to design interactive dashboards and reports that can help the management make sense of the data. This involved creating charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the data and using DAX functions to analyze the data.
Test and debug the BI solution to ensure that it is working as expected and address any issues that may arise.
Deploy the BI solution to the management and document the entire process to ensure adoption and success.
